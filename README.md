  warn("You must disable the Honey extension to continue.");
});

## Advanced Options

```js
window.couponShield.listen((warn, el, vendor) => {
  // removeHoney defaults to true (element is auto-removed).
  // Set removeHoney to false if you want to keep the Honey element for some reason.
  // vendor is "honey", "Capital One Shopping", or "Rakuten"
}, { removeHoney: false });
```

```js
window.couponShield.listen((warn) => {
  // Stop observing if nothing is detected within 10 seconds.
}, { unbindAfterSeconds: 10 });
```
